A Web App to track my Expenses across all mediums of payment.

// This is a web app to track my expenses across all mediums of payment, which can later on viewed inside the app or can be copied into the sheets or excel.

// Basic Working of App

// 1. User will have to enter the details of spending.

// You might think if user have to enter the spending then what is need of app, Can't the user directly enter it into the sheets or excel.
// 'PROBLEM' that the Ankit Tamboli i.e. I faced was that I wasn't able remember the trasactions and categories of them after few days, which I usually write into a whatsapp group.

// I track transacitons from GPay, AmazonPay, Cash and Also sometimes Friends pay my bill and sometime I pay their bill, So it gets hard to keep track of money I owe to them and also loaned money too.

// 2. the details user filled into the form will be saved into the firebase realtime database.

// 3.From there it can be copied/transfer into the Sheets or Excel.

// 4. Or you can view transactions and also filter them according to payment method, spenp on (categories), date, etc.
