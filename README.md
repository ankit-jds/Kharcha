A Web App to track my Expenses across all mediums of payment.

<br/> This is a web app to track my expenses across all mediums of payment, which can later on viewed inside the app or can be copied into the sheets or excel.

<br/> Basic Working of App

<br/> 1. User will have to enter the details of spending.

<br/> You might think if user have to enter the spending then what is need of app, Can't the user directly enter it into the sheets or excel.
<br/>'PROBLEM' that the Ankit Tamboli i.e. I faced was that I wasn't able remember the trasactions and categories of them after few days, which I usually write into a whatsapp group.

<br/> I track transacitons from GPay, AmazonPay, Cash and Also sometimes Friends pay my bill and sometime I pay their bill, So it gets hard to keep track of money I owe to them and also loaned money too.

<br/> 2. the details user filled into the form will be saved into the firebase realtime database.

<br/> 3.From there it can be copied/transfer into the Sheets or Excel.

<br/> 4. Or you can view transactions and also filter them according to payment method, spenp on (categories), date, etc.
